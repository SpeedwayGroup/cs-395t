# Assignment 3
**Due TBD at 11:59pm CDT**

By March 29th at 11:59 PM CDT, submit a private note on Ed Discussion
titled \"**Project Proposal: Name 1, Name 2, \...**\" containing:

-   Which students are in your group
-   What course project idea(s) your group is considering, which may or
    may not be from the list below
-   Your proposed plans for undertaking the idea(s), plus a break-down
    of the responsibilities of each group member. This should include
    what benchmarks you intend to study, your intended simulation
    platform, what experiments you intend to run, etc.
-   Your group's goals for the project

You can form groups of any size, but note that larger groups must have
clearly defined tasks for each group member.

Below we list some ideas that you could select for a project, though
you're also free to come up with your own idea and run it by us.
